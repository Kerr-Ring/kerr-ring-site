<h1>Biography</h1>

<br>
<br>
<p>
Kerr Ring is a Seattle based theatrical gothic metal act with elements of blackened symphonic metal. The songs tell grim tales of death and misfortune. 
<br>The band was named after "Kerr ring singularity", a scientific term describing a variance of a Black hole. We are a nerdy crowd and would like to take you on a weird musical trip beyond the horizon of darkness.
