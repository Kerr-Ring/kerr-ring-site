The shadows were her friends. Her only friends. Her only enemies. Even without much light, they crept through the room, mocking her, twisting themselves around her, pouring through her mouth and eyes as she sat still and hunched on the grimy tile. She lived in an eerie, quiet, empty room, as empty as herself. But Avolition was not nothing. She was even worse - a pathetic, pitiable, mournful creature, overwhelmed by creeping dark. 
There may have been sunlight streaming through the small window at one point, but if it was still there, the glass was so thickly coated with dust and cockroaches that it was impossible to tell. Her sisters were out in the maze, creating and witnessing wonders and horrors past imagination. But for Avolition, no amount of desire could give her the momentum to regain strength and shake the thick rusting and heavy shackles that bound her weak limbs to the walls.
