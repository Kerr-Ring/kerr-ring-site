<h1> 1. Tormentous </h1>
On a long December night <br />
I heard a voice in the dark <br />
Saying he is not coming back <br />
And my heart skipped a beat <br />
With a growing feeling of fright <br />
I recalled the names of all the saints <br />
And whispered in the dark <br />
 <br />
Chorus 1<br />
I was praying alone<br />
That he comes back home, <br />
Holding his token of love. <br />
Growing anxious by the hour, <br />
I was waiting in the night, <br />
But nobody replied.  <br />
In my eyes burning ice, <br />
Dying glimmer of hope. <br />
Please, please, make it stop! <br />
I was praying in the night<br /> 
And as more time passed <br />
Still nobody replied.  <br />
 <br />
On a quiet December morning <br /> 
I got the phone call killing all hope, <br />
Sparked an emotion overload! <br /> 
I surgically removed my feelings - <br />
Freezing anesthesia still lasts.<br />
I relearned to live,<br /> 
Turned mourning into style. <br />
The scar in my soul never heals… <br />
 

<br />
Chorus 2<br />
I was praying alone <br />
That he comes back home, <br />
Holding his token of love <br />
Growing anxious by the hour <br />
I was waiting in the night <br />
But nobody replied.  <br />
I was praying alone <br />
To wake up from this horror, <br />
But it's still playing on. <br />
Growing anxious by the hour, <br />
I was waiting in the night <br />
But nobody replied. <br />
 <br />
Chorus 3<br />
I was praying alone <br />
That he comes back home, <br />
Holding his token of love. <br />
Growing anxious by the hour <br />
I was waiting in the night <br />
But nobody replied!  <br />
I was praying alone <br />
That he comes back home, <br />
Holding his token of love. <br />
In the darkest of night, <br />
when my eyes fully dried,<br />
I knew that the god died.<br />

<h1> 2. Mocking </h1>
Chorus <br />
Hear the rumble of the whole world crumbling.<br />
Ruins tainted with dark lies..<br />
<br />
Love that crumbled into shame.<br />
Was it true, or just a game?<br />
They laughed so long at my naivete,<br />
They hid the truth and turned away.<br />

Now I’m left with shattered trust —<br />
They thought me weak, lost in the past.<br />
The lies they whispered secretly:<br />
Everybody knew but me.<br />
<br />
Chorus <br />
Hear the rumble of the whole world crumbling.<br />
Ruins tainted with dark lies..<br />
<br />
A love so pure, now drenched in shame -<br />
Was it real, or someone's twisted game?<br />
They whispered lies, kept truth at bay.<br />
How could they all just turn away?<br />

<h1> 3. Metamorphosis </h1>

Inside me lies a cold ravine.<br />
The force pulls my will beneath.<br />
Where do I begin? At dreams' end.<br />
Is this the end? The end.<br />

Waterfalls coerce the wind to follow,<br />
Painting the surface still and bound<br />
(untouched and hollow)<br />
Clinging to my frozen sorrows <br />
(Anguished here in pain)<br />
Will I let myself drown?<br />
<br />
Chorus 1<br />
(screams)<br />
<br />
Shattered into pieces and then scattered,<br />
Left to rot.<br />
No one lent a helping hand. Abandoned, laughed at,<br />
Trampled, pestered, and again abandoned,<br />
left out -<br />
I'm a puppet in these lies entangled,<br />
Caught.<br />
METAMORPHOSIS! <br />
<br />
Chorus 2<br />
METAMORPHOSIS!<br />
(screams)<br />
Clawing my way<br />
Out of the abyss!<br />
(screams)<br />
METAMORPHOSIS!<br />
<br />
Echoes of the calm are all but gone.<br />
In this twisted game, I’m just a pawn.<br />
The ground beneath me crumbles into dust.<br />
There’s no one to save, no one to trust.<br />
Every breath I take is laced with fear.<br />
Whispers in the dark are drawing near.<br />
<br />
Chorus 3<br />
METAMORPHOSIS!<br />
(screams)<br />
I arise from the abyss<br />
METAMORPHOSIS!<br />
<br />
METAMORPHOSIS!!!<br />

<h1> 4. Agitation </h1>
Ah… I fall! <br />
I plunge into the maze.<br />
Traverse a thousand ways.<br />
I'm not afraid! <br />
<br />
This is my favorite place.<br />
When I return into the maze,<br />
I am in control<br />
Of everything and all.<br />
I am the architect,<br />
Creating boundless realms.<br />
<br />
Chorus 1<br />
I will create<br />
A world without hate,<br />
Innocent land,<br />
A new kind of game,<br />
A world without pain!<br />
<br />
When I  wander<br />
These familiar walls,<br />
Grief escapes me and<br />
Wonder  calls.<br />
Even chaos gives me bliss. <br />
Basking in power, <br />
I'm strong and brave.<br />
This thrill is all I crave!  <br />
<br />
Chorus 2<br />
I will create<br />
A world without hate,<br />
Innocent land<br />
A new kind of game.<br />
<br />
Rushing to break down next door,<br />
Will I find a friend or foe? <br />
In shadows deep where dark dreams play,<br />
Walls come alive and dance and sway.<br />
Treacherous, haunting, in the gloom,<br />
Monsters rise from shadowed rooms.<br />
You are all figments,<br />
You play my game,<br />
You are my pet night-mares! <br />
<br />
Chorus 3<br />
I will create<br />
A world without hate,<br />
Innocent land,<br />
A new kind of game.<br />
There's no fear -<br />
Nothing is real.<br />
I will return,<br />
Maybe, one day.<br />
So much to explore <br />
In this wonderful maze! <br />

<h1> 5. Hysteria </h1>
Nox et dies in luctu cōnflīgunt, <br />
Voces obscurae altum resonant, <br />
In furia dīvīna, vires ignis, <br />
Nex perpetua, condīmur in tenebris. <br />
 <br />
 <p style="color: #d8b432;">
<i>(Night and day, they fight in mourning, <br />
Dark voices echo deep, <br />
In divine fury, the power of fire, <br />
A perpetual nexus, we are buried in darkness.) <br />
</i></p>
<br />
Chorus <br />
Oculi splendent fractis vīsiōnibus,	<br />
Reālitās frangitur, timor implētur.<br />
<br />
 <p style="color: #d8b432;">
<i>(Eyes aglow with fractured thrills,<br />
Reality breaks, as fear fulfills.) <br />
</i></p>
<br />
In aulis desertis, echoe vagantur, <br />
Anima cruciata pacem fugācem quaerit, <br />
Splendor phantasmatis, sibilus dirus, <br />
Mens eius frangitur, frangendo disiecta. <br />
Filis terroris, horror effunditur, <br />
Abominatio adhuc displodit <br />
<br />
 <p style="color: #d8b432;">
<i>(In abandoned halls, echoes drift,<br />
A tormented soul seeks fleeting peace,<br />
A spectral glow, a hiss so swift,<br />
Her mind fractures, pieces cease.<br />
Threads of terror, horror spills,<br />
An abomination unravels still) <br />
</i></p>
 <br />
Chorus  <br />
Oculi splendent fractis vīsiōnibus, <br />
Reālitās frangitur, timor implētur. <br />
<br />
<p style="color: #d8b432;">
<i>(Eyes aglow with fractured thrills,<br />
Reality breaks, as fear fulfills.) <br />
</i></p>
 <br />
Ut crepusculum mundum amplexu suo circumdat, <br />
Gressus iam non sunt gratia notati. <br />
Vivida iter in nocturnas umbras deflectit, <br />
Et umbrae ad margines eius evanescentis visus insidiantur. <br />
 <br />
<p style="color: #d8b432;">
<i>(As twilight wraps the world in its embrace<br />
The steps are no longer marked by grace.<br />
A vivid journey fades to hues of night<br />
And shadows creep along the edge of her fading sight.) <br />
</i></p>
<br />
Hysteria, unguibus et lacrimīs; <br />
Irae angores implent crines; <br />
Franguntur somnia in crepusculo mentis excessu; <br />
Gurgite intus amissa, kaleidoscopic obducto. <br />
<br />
<p style="color: #d8b432;">
<i>(Hysteria, a force that claws and tears,<br />
Wraiths of anguish tangled in her hair,<br />
Shattered dreams in a twilight trance,<br />
Lost within a swirling, kaleidoscopic haze.) <br />
</i></p>

<h1> 6. Pump </h1>
I close my eyes<br />
And fall free into the Abyss.<br />
My body lies<br />
Catatonic on the hard surface, the hard surface.<br />
What do I know<br />
About the universe within, within?<br />
Free to run and crawl -<br />
The pretty heaven without sin, without sin.<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
Pump, pump, my heart.  <br />
Love and tears  <br />
For me and my fears. <br />
<br />
You're calling me:<br />
"Please, return" - you cry, cry and cry.<br />
You beg and plead<br />
And in my dreams I do try, do try.<br />
I regain sight<br />
And conscious thought returns, thought returns<br />
Into my mind,<br />
And this is where it hurts, where it hurts!<br />
<br />
(Scream) Hurts<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
Pump, pump, my heart.  <br />
Love and tears  <br />
For me and my fears. <br />
<br />
What do I know<br />
About the world outside, outside?<br />
Those people think<br />
That they are always right, always right.<br />
I close my eyes<br />
And escape into the Abyss.<br />
My body lies<br />
Motionless on the hard surface,<br />
THE HARD SURFACE!<br />
What do I know<br />
About the universe within, within?<br />
My own garden<br />
Invigorating and pristine, so pristine.<br />
I regain sight<br />
And conscious thought returns, thought returns<br />
Into my mind<br />
Why do I feel like filled with thorns?<br />
<br />
One more drop -<br />
Flows the potion of eternal life.<br />
Illusive land is filled with hypocrisy of mind.<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
Pump, pump, my heart.  <br />
Love and tears  <br />
For me and my fears. <br />
<br />
Pump, pump,<br />
Pump, pump<br />
<br />
I close my eyes,<br />
Lovingly embrace the Abyss, the Abyss.<br />
My body lies<br />
Tranquilly on the hard surface.<br />
You're calling me:<br />
"Please, return" - you cry and cry and cry.<br />
You beg and plead<br />
And in my dreams I do try.<br />
Walls surround me.<br />
Can't fight the darkness anymore, anymore.<br />
Time is grounded<br />
And the fabric of reality is torn.<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
Pump, pump, my heart.  <br />
Love and tears  <br />
For me and my fears. <br />
<br />
