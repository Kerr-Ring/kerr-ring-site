<h1>Biography</h1>

<br>
<br>
<p>
Kerr Ring is a Seattle based theatrical gothic metal act with elements of blackened symphonic metal. The songs tell grim tales of death and misfortune. 
<br>The band was named after "Kerr ring singularity", a scientific term describing a variance of a Black hole. We are a nerdy crowd and would like to take you on a weird musical trip beyond the horizon of darkness.

Formed in 2018 in the greater Seattle area, Kerr Ring quickly established themselves as a standout live band with their six-person lineup that included a violin and a keyboard. Led by vocalist Olga Nuit, Kerr Ring's dramatic and emotional sound drew influence from a wide range of rock and metal bands including Nightwish, My Dying Bride, Lacrimosa, and Aria.
In the short time since their formation, Kerr Ring has shared the stage with internationally touring bands Arkona and Metsat√∂ll, opening for them at Club Sur. Despite their promising start, the pandemic put all of Kerr Ring's plans on hiatus and band members had to focus on their own lives.
However, the band managed to release their debut EP, "Mania," on March 8, 2023. The EP features powerful, operatic vocals paired with heavy, distorted guitar riffs and soaring melodies, blending elements of gothic, symphonic, and doom metal. Notably, "Mania" includes songs written in three different languages: Russian, French, and English, showcasing the band's commitment to exploring new sonic and lyrical territories.
As of 2023, Kerr Ring is down to just two members, Olga Nuit and Andrew Hall, and has transitioned to a studio project. While the band may no longer be playing live shows, their unique sound and multilingual approach continue to captivate fans of gothic and symphonic metal. Listeners who enjoy "Mania" should keep an eye out for new singles from the band, which Olga and Andrew are currently working on.
